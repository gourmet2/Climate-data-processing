# Climate-data-processing

Hello there! I am a graduate student focusing on climate change.
Since the use of climate data is becoming more and more common, I would like to share my code with you for knowledge exchange.

The climate data I use frequently are HadISD, GSOD, reanalysis products, and climate model outputs (CMIP6 and AMIP6). So I am familiar with them. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me.

Most of the time, I use Matlab to work with these data. For machine learning, I would choose Python.
